===============================

Catalog your chaos. Embrace the goon.

📁 WHAT IS THIS?

with chaotic precision and industrial strength looping. It's like a file viewer...
but unhinged.

Features include:

- 🎥 VLC-powered video playback with smooth seeking
- 🎞️ Custom clip looping and export
- 🧠 Playlists for that custom goon experience
- 🔧 Keyboard shortcut customization
- 🤖 Gamepad control (yes, really)

-------------
1. Unzip this folder anywhere you like.
2. Run `EDGR.exe` (double-click or launch from terminal).
3. Select a source folder of media files.
4. Scroll, sort, loop, clip, and collect.
5. You are now gooning. There is no step 6.
